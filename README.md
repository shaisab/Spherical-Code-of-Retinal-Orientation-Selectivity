# Spherical Code of Retinal Orientation Selectivity

This code allows mapping the response polarity and orientation preference of orientation selective retinal ganglion cells (OSGCs) in the mouse retina. This includes registration of calcium imaging data, unsupervised clustering of OSGCs, assessment of the alignment between OSGC preferences and diverse spherical model families, estimation of the relative abundance of OSGC subtypes, transformation from retinocentric to egocentric coordinates, and the encoding and decoding of edge orientation.
